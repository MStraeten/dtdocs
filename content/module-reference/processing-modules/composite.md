Drag and drop an image from the film strip onto the "drom image from filmstrip here" box to have the image overlayed ontop of the currently edited image. Then adjust the various placement and adjustment attributes of the image being overlayed.

The image used must be imported into darktable.

The full history stack of the overlayed image is used by the module, so if you want to drastically change the overlayed image beyond the controls of this module, you should edit the image separately.
